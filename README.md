# 2019_Potato crop nutritional status

### Balancing the nutritional status of potato crops.

## Provisional Abstract

The science of ionomics that relates tissue nutrient profiles to genetics provides continuous variables that may reflect the differential nutrient status and tuber yield potentials of potato (_Solanum tuberosum L._) cultivars. New potato cultivars are being developed and assigned solely to maturity groups and still require fertilizer trials. However, nutrient management may be related to cultivar ionomes with known response to fertilizers. Our objective was to predict potato tuber yields using foliar ionomes. The dataset comprised 151 potato N, P and K fertilization trials where the first mature leaves from top were sampled at the beginning of flowering for total N, P, K, Ca, and Mg analysis. Nutrient concentrations (ionomes) were preprocessed by adjusting each nutrient to the geometric mean of all nutrients and to a filling value producing row-centered log ratios (_clr_) to measure similarities between cultivars and assess their effects on tubers yield. Supervised learning classification models were selected to assess tubers marketable yield predictive accuracy. The clustering algorithm failed to delineate groups of cultivars sharing similar ionomes. The machine learning models showed fair diagnostic potential to detect in-season nutrient imbalance of potato cultivars using clr variables. The average accuracy metric was 70% on the testing set and varied between cultivars reaching up to 100%. Ionomes of new cultivars could be assigned to the closest cultivar ionome hyper-blob where nutrient requirements had been already documented by fertilizer trials.
